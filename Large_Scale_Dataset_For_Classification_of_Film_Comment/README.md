# Large Scale Dataset For Classification of Film Comment

## Introduction
This is a Large Scale Dataset For Classification of Film Comment, which includes about 90W comments with label. And this repository includes the comment dataset and the merge code. You can use the merge code to merge the .txt file in this repository.

## Effectiveness
I have conducted ablation experiments on many available film comment classifier on github. I used this dataset to train the classifers and evaluate them on test dataset, which can outperform these models which were trained on a small dataset.
